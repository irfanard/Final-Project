# Thera Bank Personal Loan for Customer Classification

## Source:
This project use dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/itsmesunil/bank-loan-modelling)

## General Information:
The dataset about a bank (Thera Bank) which has a growing customer base. Majority of these customers are liability customers (depositors) with varying size of deposits. The number of customers who are also borrowers (asset customers) is quite small, and the bank is interested in expanding this base rapidly to bring in more loan business and in the process, earn more through the interest on loans. In particular, the management wants to explore ways of converting its liability customers to personal loan customers (while retaining them as depositors). A campaign that the bank ran last year for liability customers showed a healthy conversion rate of over 9% success. This has encouraged the retail marketing department to devise campaigns to better target marketing to increase the success ratio with a minimal budget

## Goal
Main goal of this project wants to build a model that will help them identify the potential customers who have a higher probability of accept the loan. This will increase the success ratio while at the same time reduce the cost of the campaign

## Method
There are three steps followed by this project:
1. Data visualization: data analysis to understand missing values, data relations and usefulness of features, and get insight from the data
2. Preprocessing:  preprocessing data consist of dealing with missing values, drop unuseful features.
3. Classifier: Using Machine Learning technique to predict or classifier customer who accept personal loan

## Conclusions
After experiment using some technique for classifiers (Logistic regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest), got Random forest is best and suit for this model with accuracy 96 %
